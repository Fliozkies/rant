CHOOSING PROPER HTML5 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS

Is this the unique core of the page? → <main>
Is it reusable standalone content? → <article>
Is it grouped by topic with a heading? → <section>
Is it navigation? → <nav>
Is it secondary or tangential? → <aside>
Is it introductory? → <header>
Is it closing/meta info? → <footer>
Is it media + caption? → <figure>
Is it contact or author information for the nearest article or page, not random locations? → <address>
None of the above? → <div>
