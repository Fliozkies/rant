A rant website.

nav contains = about, self-rants, public-rants, login

at about tab, it contains information about the site.

at self-rants tab, one can post a rant. Consecutive rants or rants under that post
-be next in line. They can be read by clicking the arrow pointer.

at public-rants tab, one can see rants posted by either anonymous or unanonymous users. These
-are rants that intentionally posted publicly as the user wants to be seen/heard, and is 
-interested to hearing out what others have to say.

login tab is self-explanatory. This is also not required in order for a user to be able to post
-rants. This ensures flexibility and anonymousity of the user if willed.
